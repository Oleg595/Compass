Objective:   Maximize(R0)
 
SUBMITTED
Model size:       12 constraints,      13 variables,           28 non-zeros.
Sets:                                   0 GUB,                  0 SOS.
 
Using DUAL simplex for phase 1 and PRIMAL simplex for phase 2.
The primal and dual simplex pricing strategy set to 'Devex'.
 
The model is INFEASIBLE
lp_solve unsuccessful after 2 iter and a last best value of -1e+030

 MEMO: lp_solve version 5.5.2.0 for 64 bit OS, with 64 bit REAL variables.
      In the total iteration count 2, 0 (0.0%) were bound flips.
      There were 1 refactorizations, 0 triggered by time and 0 by density.
       ... on average 2.0 major pivots per refactorization.
      The largest [LUSOL v2.2.1.0] fact(B) had 13 NZ entries, 1.0x largest basis.
      The constraint matrix inf-norm is 1, with a dynamic range of 1.
      Time to load data was 0.000 seconds, presolve used 0.000 seconds,
       ... 0.001 seconds in simplex solver, in total 0.001 seconds.
